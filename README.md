# PDHCG.jl

This repository contains the official implementation of the restarted Primal-Dual Hybrid Conjugate Gradient (PDHCG) algorithm for solving large-scale convex quadratic programming problems[PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160).

Part of the code utilizes [PDQP.jl](https://github.com/jinwen-yang/PDQP.jl) by Jinwen Yang and Haihao Lu.

## Setup

A one-time step is required to set up the necessary packages on the local machine:

```sh
julia --project -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

## Test

To test if the setup is successful, use the following command:

All commands below assume that the current directory is the working directory.

```sh
julia runtest.jl
```

If the setup is completed correctly, you should see the following output:

```.

CPU test: SUCCESS
GPU test: SUCCESS

Test Summary: | Pass  Total   Time
Solver Test   |    2      2   <time>
```

## Running

### API for using PDHCG

`solve.jl` is the recommended script for using PDHCG, which uses command-line arguments to pass parameters. The results are written in JSON and text files.

```sh
$ julia --project scripts/solve.jl \
--instance_path=INSTANCE_PATH --output_directory=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY \ 
--tolerance=TOLERANCE --time_sec_limit=TIME_SEC_LIMIT --use_gpu=USE_GPU
```

`run.jl` is a script for using PDHCG to solve QP instances. It uses function calls for parameter passing.

### Solving Datasets

`run.jl` is suitable to solve instances in given datasets by setting `folder_path` item in this file.

  For example, to solve example files, you can set the `folder_path` as follows:
  
```sh
folder_path = "./example/" 
```
All datasets we used can be found at [Here](https://github.com/Lhongpei/QP_datasets)
### Data Requirement

Input data shouldn't have any constraint with inf upper-bound and -inf lower-bound.

## Interpreting the output

A table of iteration stats will be printed with the following headings.

### runtime

- `#iter`: the current iteration number.
- `#kkt`: the cumulative number of times the KKT matrix is multiplied.
- `seconds`: the cumulative solve time in seconds.

### residuals

- `pr norm`: the Euclidean norm of primal residuals (i.e., the constraint violation).
- `du norm`: the Euclidean norm of the dual residuals.
- `gap`: the gap between the primal and dual objective.

### solution information

- `pr obj`: the primal objective value.
- `pr norm`: the Euclidean norm of the primal variable vector.
- `du norm`: the Euclidean norm of the dual variable vector.

### relative residuals

- `rel pr`: the Euclidean norm of the primal residuals, relative to the right-hand side.
- `rel dul`: the Euclidean norm of the dual residuals, relative to the primal linear objective.
- `rel gap`: the relative optimality gap.
  
### At the end of the run, the following summary information will be printed

- Total Iterations: The total number of Primal-Dual iterations.

- CG  iteration: The total number of Conjugate Gradient iterations.

- Solving Status: Indicating if it found an optimal solution.

### Others

- `json2csv.jl` is a utility to summarize all output files.
